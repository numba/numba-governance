# Communication Channels

For Numba to be a successful open source software project, communication with the community is important.  This page outlines the different communication methods that should be used for project development and discussion.

## Chat

For interactive discussions and coordination of development activities in realtime, these Gitter channels should be used:

* https://gitter.im/numba/numba - General Numba discussion and support
* https://gitter.im/numba/numba-dev - Project development specific discussion

To keep the volume on the numba-dev channel low, Core Team members may politely ask that discussions not directly pertinent to Numba development move to the numba/numba channel.  Important decisions or discussions that happen in numba-dev chat should be reviewed in the weekly meeting and reflected in the meeting minutes.

## Mailing List

Longer discussions and support questions can be asked on the Numba Users mailing list:

* https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!forum/numba-users

Violations of the code of conduct should be reported via email to the Code of Conduct subcomittee (numba-conduct@googlegroups.com) as described in [this document](code-of-conduct.md).  This email will be kept private to the Code of Conduct Subcommittee.

## GitHub

Bugs and feature requests are best communicated as GitHub issues in the relevant repository. (Ex: https://github.com/numba/numba/issues)  Support questions ("How do I...") are more appropriate for email or chat.

## Weekly Meetings

Core Team members will be invited to weekly status update meetings.  Attendance is optional, and meeting topics and discussion will be summarized in public meeting minutes in the [numba-governance wiki](https://github.com/numba/numba-governance/wiki).
